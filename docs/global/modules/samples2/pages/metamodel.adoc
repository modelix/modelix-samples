:navtitleshort-description.adoc: Metamodel

The MPS language (aka. metamodel) used in all examples is the same.
It is fairly small as describes simplified lecture schedule.

NOTE: The language intentionally does not use expressions, creating editors for expressions by hand is tedious, and modelix has no support for generating these editors for you.

// TODO Olekz upate, after describing uses casdes
The main concepts of the language are:

- Room: where lecture are held. Each room has a maximum capacity of students, a name and some additional properties.
- Lecture:
Have a name, some description and reference a room where they are held. And also have a schedule which determines when
they are held and if they repeat through the whole semester or are a one time lecture.
- Student:
A student with a name and birthday.
- Assignment:
Lecture assignments for a single student.

Some concepts are contained a root node like a `Rooms` container to make structuring the editors in MPS easier:
