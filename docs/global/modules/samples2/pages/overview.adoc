:navtitleshort-description.adoc: Overview

The samples are structured into uses cases.
Each use case uses different components from the modelix platform
to create custom solutions.

On this page, you can get an overview of all uses cases,
and see how they are related and what their essential differences are.

== Introduction

include::samples2:partial$short-description.adoc[]

None of the examples try to reuse editors defined in MPS.
If your goal is to reuse MPS editors as is then modelix itself ships with a https://lp.jetbrains.com/projector/[Projector] integration to achieve this.

While all the examples use the same language defined in MPS they are not meant as one complete example but rather as individual parts.
The purpose of the examples is to give inspiration of what is possible with modelix and make you think and envision your own use cases.
