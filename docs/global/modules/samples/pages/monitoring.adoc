= Monitoring the `model-server`
:navtitle: Monitoring the `model-server`

Besides the afore mentioned use cases, the samples also include a `model-server` monitoring setup.
This setup uses the `/metrics` endpoint  xref:core:howto/metrics.adoc[provided by the `model-server` by default].

== Instructions

=== Start the components

.Command to start the monitoring profile
[source,shell]
----
docker-compose --profile monitoring up
----

This command starts the following components:

* `model-server` at http://localhost:28101/[],
* Prometheus database at http://localhost:9090/[], and
* Grafana dashboard at http://localhost:3001/[].


NOTE: Make sure you picked the correct instance at the top of the Grafana dashboard.

[NOTE]
====
Depending on your operating system or docker setup, you might need to adjust the targets defined in the `prometheus.yml` and `datasource.yml`.

Also, the docker network setup might need adjustments in the `docker-compose.yaml`.

=== Engage with the `model-server`

In order to see noteworthy changes in the monitoring setup, you can simply direct any request towards the `model-server`.
This process can be simplified by using the Swagger UI included in the `model-server` over at http://127.0.0.1:28101/swagger[].

NOTE: You can also start the other use cases in parallel.

[NOTE]
====
If you want to start everything at the same time, you can simply start the `all` profile via

.Command to start the monitoring profile
[source,shell]
----
docker-compose --profile all up
----
